# FDM-Halo-Collision
This collection of code uses gravhopper to simulate a FDM halo and a collision between two FDM halos. The mass function used for the
FDM halo comes from Bernal et al (2017).

The python file and video entitled FDM_merger show a merger between two FDM halos of equal mass, separated by 11.4 kpc, in the xy-plane.

The following video shows the outcome of the simulation:

Similarly, the python file and video entited FDM_halo show the evolution of a FDM halo.
The following video showd the outcome of the simulation:
